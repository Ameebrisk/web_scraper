Web scraping is when you extract content and data from a website. 
You create a spread sheet with all the info. 
Jason wrote a program that would look for what he wanted on the BULQ website. 
We are going to learn how to webscrape the internet. 
Couple of tools you can use in python to give you the output that you want. 

Challenges: websites change all the time. If the websites change then it will break 
your website. 
It wont be consistent.
Security can be an issue if you have a website that requires you to login. 

Web scraping can look malicious if not done correctly. 

We are going to look at a fake python

url = 'https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/'

page = requests.get(url)

print(page.text)

Terminal commands

pipenv shell 
pipenv install requests




should return this with page
